Our project focuses on machine learning using an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model. 

We trained the model on EEG data found publicly. OpenNeuro is an open platform where neural data can be found in all formats. We chose EEG data because it is the best at capturing temporal resolution. This means that the smallest changes in the brain can be tracked to the millisecond. This is important when measuring brain activity when stimulated in different ways emotionally. 

The EEG dataset found on OpenNeuro was collected from a psychology study where researchers were investigating brain activity across 7 emotional categories: joy, inspiration, tenderness, fear, disgust, sadness, and neutral. There were 60 subjects in the original however, due to the large file size, we conducted our project on 10 of those subjects (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12).
